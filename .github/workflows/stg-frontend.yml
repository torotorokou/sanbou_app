# - This workflow pushes to Artifact Registry and uses secrets; ensure it's not run in forked PR contexts.

  # Best practices:
  # - Do not print or upload tokens. Store temporary .env under $RUNNER_TEMP and delete after use.
  # - Keep public values (e.g., REGION, STAGE) in repo/org Variables; keep secrets for credentials only.
